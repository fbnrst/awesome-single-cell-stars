      "description": "The unique features of scRNA-seq data have led to the development of novel methods for differential expression (DE) analysis. However, few of the existing DE methods for scRNA-seq data estimate the number of molecules pre-dropout and therefore do not explicitly distinguish technical and biological zeroes. We develop DECENT, a DE method for scRNA-seq data that adjusts for the imperfect capture efficiency by estimating the number of molecules pre-dropout.",

      "description": "Provides two algorithms for marker selection (G-PC, CEM-PC) introduced in [Multiset multicover methods for discriminative marker selection](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(22)00229-6). Most marker selection methods focus on differential expression (DE) analysis. Although such methods work well for data with a few non-overlapping marker sets, they are not appropriate for large atlas-size datasets where several cell types and tissues are considered. To address this, we define the phenotype cover (PC) problem for marker selection and present algorithms that can improve the discriminative power of marker sets.",

      "description": "A normalization method to remove unwanted variation using both control and target genes. It takes advantage of the fact that genes in a scRNAseq study often can be naturally classified into two sets: a control set of genes that are free of effects of the predictor variables and a target set of genes that are of primary interest. By modeling the two sets of genes jointly using the partial least squares regression, scPLS is capable of making full use of the data to improve the inference of confounding effects. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13665-w",

We develop a model that uses this network to discriminate biological vs. technical zeros, by exploiting each gene's local neighborhood. For non-biological zeros, we build a predictive model to impute the missing value using their most informative neighbors.",
